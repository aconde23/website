<p>Trinity has a beautiful campus. It is located just outside downtown San Antonio. The campus consists of two parts: upper and lower campus. On lower campus, you can find student dorms, Mabee Dining Hall, and the athletics center and fields. On upper campus, you can find all the academic buildings, Coates Student Center, and admissions among other things. I like Trinity's campus because, although the campus supports a small school population, it does not feel like a small school campus. The campus also features many greenspaces to either find a quiet place to study or simply relax. An added advantage of the school's small size is that it give you the ability to walk from one end of the campus to the other end in about ten minutes.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are its small size which allows small classes. My largest class has about thirty people in it, so there is never a struggle between the professor's lecture and the class size. The small class sizes also make professers very accessible, and I have been able to meet with professors when I need help and to get to know them.</p>
<p>I chose Trinity University because of the combination of challenging academics and competitive athletics that it provides. I knew I wanted to participate in college swimming, and I was able to do that at Trinity along with getting a quality, well-rounded education.</p>
<p>I am thinking of majoring in chemistry and minoring in mathematics because I have always loved the sciences, and I want to attend medical school after graduating from Trinity. Majoring in chemistry both fulfills my desire to make a career in STEM and will aid in the preparation for medical school. I want to minor in mathematics because a strong background in mathematics aids in the understanding and application of the sciences.
